Our curatorial approach treats sales as a cultural narrative, showcasing artifacts, personal accounts, and multimedia presentations that reveal the deep influence of these individuals on business, marketing, and social mobility.\n",
        "                Our exhibitions bring history to life, but our mission extends beyond preservation. The American Museum of Traveling Salespeople fosters collaboration with historians, business leaders, and storytellers, ensuring that these legacies are studied, understood, and appreciated by future generations.\n",
        "                The Routes & Roads Project expands our work by uncovering and sharing overlooked stories—from the door-to-door peddlers of the early 20th century to the traveling tech sales reps of today. This year’s theme, \"Pitches, Promises, and Persistence,\" explores the tools, tactics, and tales of those who sold everything from encyclopedias to vacuum cleaners, miracle cures to life insurance. Each exhibit invites visitors to reflect on how sales shaped American innovation and the enduring legacy of those who made their living on the move.\"\"\"\n",
